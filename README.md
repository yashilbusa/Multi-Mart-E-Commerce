# Start of Internship

## 1️⃣ week 1
### *1st May 2024*
- *Learning the Basic front end Technology* : Learning the basic front-end technologies is a crucial step for anyone aspiring to become a web developer or improve their web development skills. Front-end technologies are responsible for creating the user interface and user experience of websites and web applications. Here are some key points to keep in mind while learning the basic front-end technology
• React Js
• Redux Js Module
• HTML
• JAVSCRIPT

### *Here is the Outine of Week-1:*

1. ReactJs
   ReactJS, developed and maintained by Facebook, is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces,         
   particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render         efficiently in response to data changes. ReactJS is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and performance, making it a         preferred choice for many modern web development projects.
2. ReduxJs
   ReduxJS is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, widely used in
   conjunction with ReactJS to manage the application state in a more structured and maintainable way. Redux centralizes the       application's state and logic, enabling powerful capabilities like time-travel debugging and state persistence. This makes      Redux an essential tool for building complex applications with predictable behavior.
3. JAVASCRIPT
   JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language that is primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic          behavior to web pages. Developed by Brendan Eich in the mid-1990s, it has become an essential component of web development,     enabling developers to create interactive user interfaces, handle user events, manipulate data, and communicate with servers.
